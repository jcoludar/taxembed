# Development Journey: From Facebook's Poincaré Embeddings to Hierarchical Taxonomy Embeddings

## Overview

This document chronicles the evolution of this project from Facebook Research's original Poincaré embeddings implementation to a specialized hierarchical taxonomy embedding system for NCBI's biological taxonomy.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation - Facebook's Poincaré Embeddings

### **Starting Point**
We began with Facebook Research's implementation of Poincaré embeddings, as described in their 2017 paper "Poincaré Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations."

**Original Features:**
- Hyperbolic geometry (Poincaré ball model)
- Designed for hierarchical data (e.g., WordNet)
- Pure parent-child edge training
- Simple negative sampling

**Initial Success:**
- Successfully trained 2.7M NCBI taxonomy organisms
- Model converged in ~1 hour on CPU
- Basic hierarchical structure preserved

### **Key Insight**
The Facebook implementation worked but was designed for simpler hierarchies. We needed enhancements for biological taxonomy with 38 depth levels and complex relationships.

---

## Phase 2: Data Quality Issues (Nov 5-7, 2025)

### **Critical Bugs Discovered**

#### **Bug #1: Header Lines in Edgelist Files**
```
Problem: .edgelist files had "id1 id2" header treated as real organism IDs
Result: 111,105 nodes (2 fake + 111,103 real)
Fix: Updated prepare_taxonomy_data.py to skip headers
Impact: Clean datasets with correct node counts
```

#### **Bug #2: Mapping File Inconsistencies**
```
Problem: .mapping.tsv had fake TaxIDs "id1" and "id2" at indices 0 and 1
Fix: Regenerated mappings without header artifacts
Impact: Proper TaxID → index mapping
```

#### **Bug #3: No Data Validation**
```
Solution: Created scripts/validate_data.py
Features:
  - Validates node counts
  - Checks for duplicates
  - Verifies index continuity
  - Reports statistics
```

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/validate_data.py`
- `scripts/regenerate_data.sh`
- `DATA_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`

---

## Phase 3: Hierarchical Training Attempt #1 (Nov 7-8, 2025)

### **Motivation**
Simple parent-child training doesn't capture full hierarchy. Organisms at depth 20 should be "far" from root in hyperbolic space.

### **Strategy: Transitive Closure**
Instead of 100K parent-child edges, train on ALL ancestor-descendant pairs:

```
Parent-child:     58,663 pairs (6%)
Grandparent:      52,953 pairs (5%)
Deep ancestors:  864,280 pairs (89%)
Total:           975,896 pairs (9.8x more data!)
```

### **Implementation**
Created `build_transitive_closure.py`:
- Loads NCBI taxonomy tree
- Computes all ancestor paths
- Adds depth metadata
- Outputs 975K training pairs

### **Critical Bug: TaxID as Index**
```
Problem: Used TaxIDs directly as embedding indices
Result: Created 3,467,244 embeddings (instead of 111,103)
Symptom: 97% of embeddings never updated!
Fix: Properly read mapping file with header
Impact: Reduced to 92,290 embeddings (correct)
```

**Files Created:**
- `build_transitive_closure.py`
- `BUGS_FOUND_AND_FIXED.md`
- `sanity_check.py` (comprehensive validation)

---

## Phase 4: Hierarchical Features (Nov 8, 2025)

### **New Training Features Implemented**

#### **1. Depth-Aware Initialization**
```python
# Root (depth 0): radius ≈ 0.1 (near center)
# Leaves (depth 38): radius ≈ 0.95 (near boundary)
target_radius = 0.1 + (depth / max_depth) * 0.85
```

#### **2. Radial Regularization**
```python
# Soft penalty to encourage depth → radius mapping
reg_loss = λ * (actual_radius - target_radius)²
```

#### **3. Hard Negative Sampling**
```python
# Sample negatives from same depth (cousins, not random)
siblings = nodes_at_same_depth(node)
negatives = random.sample(siblings, n_negatives)
```

#### **4. Depth Weighting**
```python
# Deeper pairs are more informative
weight = sqrt(depth_diff + 1)
loss = loss * weight
```

#### **5. Ranking Loss with Margin**
```python
# Encourage: d(ancestor, descendant) < d(ancestor, negative) + margin
loss = relu(pos_dist - neg_dist + margin)
```

**Files Created:**
- `train_hierarchical.py`
- `run_hierarchical_training.sh`

---

## Phase 5: Ball Constraint Enforcement (Nov 8, 2025)

### **The Problem: Embeddings Escaping**

Training iterations showed embeddings violating the Poincaré ball constraint (||x|| ≥ 1.0):

| Version | Max Norm | Outside Ball | Issue |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------|
| v1 | 2.18 | 50K (54%) | Weak regularization |
| v2 | 1.45 | 2K (2.2%) | Better but not enough |

### **Root Causes**
1. Regularization too weak (λ=0.01)
2. Learning rate too high (0.01)
3. No gradient control
4. Projection insufficient

### **Solution: 3-Layer Enforcement Strategy**

#### **Layer 1: Improved Hyperparameters**
```python
Learning rate: 0.01 → 0.005 (2x slower)
Regularization: 0.01 → 0.1 (10x stronger)
Gradient clipping: None → max_norm=1.0
```

#### **Layer 2: Hard Projection**
```python
# Only scale embeddings that violate constraint
needs_projection = (norms >= 1.0)
scale = where(needs_projection, (1-eps)/norms, 1.0)
```

#### **Layer 3: Periodic Full Projection**
```python
# Every 500 batches: project ALL embeddings
if n_batches % 500 == 0:
    model.project_to_ball(indices=None)

# End of epoch: GUARANTEE all inside ball
model.project_to_ball(indices=None)
```

### **Results**
| Version | Max Norm | Outside Ball | Status |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------|
| v3 | 1.00 | 0 (0%) | ✅ Perfect |

**Files Created:**
- `BALL_CONSTRAINT_ENFORCEMENT.md`
- `TRAINING_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`

---

## Phase 6: Performance Optimizations (Nov 8, 2025)

### **Critical Optimizations**

#### **1. Regularizer Vectorization**
```
Before: Loop over 111K nodes per batch (1.7B ops/epoch)
After: Precompute tensors once (111K ops/epoch)
Speedup: 1000x
```

#### **2. Selective Projection**
```
Before: Project all 92K embeddings every batch
After: Project only updated ~3K embeddings per batch
Speedup: 30x
```

#### **3. Efficient Tensor Creation**
```
Before: List of numpy arrays → tensor (slow)
After: Pre-allocate numpy array → tensor (fast)
Speedup: 10-100x
```

#### **4. Device Selection**
```
Before: Auto-select MPS on M3 Mac → hang
After: Force CPU (stable on macOS)
Result: Training actually runs!
```

**Overall:** From hanging indefinitely to ~3 minutes/epoch

---

## Current State (Nov 8, 2025, 4:00pm)

### **What Works ✅**

1. **Data Pipeline**
   - ✅ Correct TaxID → index mapping
   - ✅ 92,290 embeddings (not 3.4M)
   - ✅ 975,896 training pairs (transitive closure)
   - ✅ Comprehensive validation (sanity_check.py)

2. **Ball Constraints**
   - ✅ 100% embeddings inside ball
   - ✅ Max norm = 1.000 (perfect)
   - ✅ 3-layer enforcement strategy

3. **Training Stability**
   - ✅ No crashes or hangs
   - ✅ Gradient clipping prevents exploding gradients
   - ✅ ~3 minutes per epoch on CPU
   - ✅ Automatic checkpointing (keeps last 5 + best)

### **What Doesn't Work ❌**

**Hierarchy Quality is Poor:**
```
Depth-norm correlation: +0.003 (target: >0.5)
Phylum separation:      1.08x   (target: >1.5x)
Class separation:       0.99x   (target: >1.5x)
Order separation:       0.99x   (target: >1.5x)
```

**Hypothesis:** Only 2 epochs completed before manual stop. Possible issues:
- Need more training time
- Regularization too strong (λ=0.1 may be constraining)
- Data imbalance (94% deep pairs, only 6% parent-child)
- Margin too small (0.2) for hierarchical differences

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Data Quality is Critical**
- Always validate input data
- Don't assume file formats
- Use automated checks (sanity_check.py)
- A single wrong mapping can waste hours

### **2. Constraints Are Hard**
- Poincaré ball constraint (||x|| < 1) requires careful handling
- Need multiple enforcement layers
- Trade-off between constraint and optimization freedom
- "Technically correct" ≠ "semantically good"

### **3. Start Simple, Then Add Complexity**
- Facebook's simple model worked for 2.7M organisms
- Our complex model has perfect constraints but poor hierarchy
- Sometimes simpler is better
- Validate each feature independently

### **4. Hyperbolic Space is Different**
- Distances grow exponentially near boundary
- Small norm differences = large distance differences
- Regularization interacts with geometry
- Need domain-specific tuning

### **5. Documentation Matters**
- Intermediate docs helped track decisions
- Checkpoint management saves work
- Reproducibility requires clear instructions
- Future self will thank you

---

## Next Steps & Open Questions

### **Immediate Actions**
1. Train longer (try 20-50 epochs with patience=10)
2. If no improvement, reduce regularization (λ=0.05)
3. Monitor depth-norm correlation each epoch
4. Try balanced sampling (equal parent-child vs deep pairs)

### **Research Questions**
1. Is transitive closure helping or hurting?
2. Are 31K siblings per node too many for hard negatives?
3. What's the optimal regularization strength?
4. Should margin vary by depth level?
5. Is curriculum learning needed (parent-child → grandparent → all)?

### **Alternative Approaches**
1. Go back to simple training (known to work)
2. Use Riemannian optimizer (respects manifold natively)
3. Try different hyperbolic models (Lorentz, Klein)
4. Implement progressive training (build hierarchy bottom-up)

---

## Phase 6: Small Dataset Success (Nov 8-9, 2025)

### **Breakthrough: Fixed Early Stopping Bug**

**The Problem:**
```python
# BUG: tracker.update() updates best_loss BEFORE comparison
tracker.update(epoch, metrics)  
if avg_loss < tracker.best_loss:  # Always comparing against self!
    epochs_without_improvement = 0
```

**Result:** Early stopping triggered after 5 epochs despite continuous improvement.

**The Fix:**
```python
# Save previous best BEFORE updating
prev_best_loss = tracker.best_loss
tracker.update(epoch, metrics)
if avg_loss < prev_best_loss:  # Compare against OLD best
    epochs_without_improvement = 0
```

### **Training Success on Small Dataset (111K organisms)**

Ran `train_small.py` with corrected early stopping:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Best Epoch** | 28 |
| **Final Loss** | 0.472317 |
| **Improvement** | 51.6% (from 0.977) |
| **Training Time** | ~2.5 hours |
| **Organisms** | 92,290 embedded |

### **Model Quality Metrics**

✅ **Perfect Ball Constraint**
- All embeddings inside unit ball (max norm = 1.0000)
- Mean norm: 0.7147
- 24,979 nodes near boundary (deep in hierarchy)
- 9,275 nodes near center (root/shallow)

✅ **Hierarchical Structure**
- Clear depth stratification
- Proper taxonomic clustering
- Meaningful nearest neighbors

### **Visualization Results**

**Multi-Group UMAP:**
- Mammals: 422 organisms
- Birds: 3,187 organisms
- Insects: 11,200 organisms
- Bacteria: 18,584 organisms
- Fungi: 1,002 organisms
- Plants: 14,744 organisms

All groups properly clustered with clear separation!

## Phase 7: Scaling Challenges (Nov 9-10, 2025)

### **Attempt 1: Full Dataset (2.7M organisms)**

**Problem:** Out of memory during transitive closure construction
```bash
python build_transitive_closure_full.py
# KILLED - Process terminated
```

**Root Cause:** O(n²) sibling map construction for hard negative sampling with 2.7M nodes = ~7.3 trillion operations

### **Attempt 2: Animals Subset (Metazoa, 1.05M organisms)**

**Strategy:**
1. Filter to animals only (TaxID 33208)
2. Build transitive closure: 22.1M training pairs
3. Use random negatives instead of hard negatives

**Result:** Trained 4 epochs before manual stop

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Organisms** | 1,055,469 |
| **Training Pairs** | 22,135,131 |
| **Best Loss** | 0.634712 (epoch 4) |
| **Improvement** | 20.4% |
| **Model Size** | 40.3 MB |

### **Issue: Insufficient Training**
- Only 4 epochs vs 28 needed for convergence
- Loss still decreasing (not converged)
- UMAP showed scattered clusters

**Created:** `continue_animals_training.py` to resume training (not used - opted to focus on small dataset success instead)

---

## Phase 8: Hyperbolic Geometry Corrections (Nov 10, 2025)

### **Critical Realization: Wrong Distance Metric**

**The Problem:**
```python
# WRONG: Using Euclidean distance for hyperbolic embeddings
umap.UMAP(metric='euclidean')  # ❌ Treats hyperbolic space as flat
```

Poincaré embeddings live in **hyperbolic space**, but we were visualizing them with **Euclidean distance** - fundamentally incorrect!

### **The Fix: Proper Poincaré Distance**

Implemented correct hyperbolic distance:
```python
def poincare_distance(x, y):
    """
    Poincaré distance formula (respects hyperbolic geometry)
    """
    diff_norm_sq = ||x - y||²
    x_norm_sq = ||x||²
    y_norm_sq = ||y||²
    
    ratio = 1 + 2 * diff_norm_sq / ((1 - x_norm_sq)(1 - y_norm_sq))
    return arcosh(ratio)

# Correct UMAP usage
umap.UMAP(metric='precomputed')  # Use precomputed Poincaré distances
```

### **Impact of Correction**

| Visualization | Distance | Geometry | Result |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Previous | Euclidean | ❌ Wrong | Distorted, scattered |
| **Corrected** | **Poincaré** | **✅ Correct** | **True hierarchical structure** |

**Key Difference:**
- Euclidean distance range: [0, ~2]  
- Poincaré distance range: [0, ~19] - respects hyperbolic expansion

### **Lessons Learned**

1. **Geometry matters:** Hyperbolic embeddings require hyperbolic distances
2. **Complexity tradeoff:** Poincaré distance is O(n²), limiting sample size
3. **Validation importance:** Always verify mathematical correctness, not just implementation

---

## Phase 9: Enhanced Training & Repository Organization (Nov 13-14, 2025)

### **Training Script Evolution**

#### **Three Training Approaches Now Available:**

1. **`embed.py` - Original Facebook Trainer (Proven)**
   - Battle-tested on 2.7M full dataset
   - Uses simple `.mapped.edgelist` format
   - Critical fix applied: embedding initialization scale = 0.1 (not 1e-4)
   - Parameters validated from memory: `-lr 0.1 -burnin 10 -negs 50`
   - Status: ✅ Fully working

2. **`train_hierarchical.py` - Core Hierarchical Library**
   - Implements advanced features:
     - Depth-aware initialization
     - Transitive closure training (975K pairs)
     - Hard negative sampling (cousin nodes)
     - Radial regularizer (depth → radius mapping)
   - Proper Poincaré distance computation
   - Early stopping with patience
   - Status: ✅ Core implementation complete

3. **`train_small.py` - Enhanced User Interface**
   - Wrapper around `train_hierarchical.py`
   - Enhanced terminal visualization:
     - Color-coded improvements (green/red)
     - Epoch-to-epoch comparisons (ΔLoss, % change)
     - Real-time metrics (loss, reg, norm, outside%)
     - Visual status indicators (✓ BETTER / ✗ WORSE)
   - Better data handling (fills missing node depths)
   - Automatic best model checkpointing
   - Status: ✅ Production-ready for small dataset

#### **Command for Extended Training:**
```bash
uv run python train_small.py --epochs 999999 --early-stopping 0
```
This runs indefinitely with enhanced visualization until manual stop (Ctrl+C).

   - Gitignore properly excludes local artifacts (checkpoints, plots, data)
   - Documentation structure supports different user needs

---

## Phase 10: Unified CLI & Enhanced Visualization (Dec 2025)

### **Streamlined Training & Visualization Pipeline**

#### **The Vision**
Create a unified CLI that allows users to:
1. Train models for any clade with a single command: `taxembed train <clade> -as <tag>`
2. Visualize results automatically: `taxembed visualize <tag>`
3. Build custom datasets on-the-fly using TaxoPy
4. Track all artifacts (checkpoints, metadata, plots) in organized tag directories

#### **Implementation: Unified CLI**

**Created `src/taxembed/cli/main.py`:**
- Single entry point: `taxembed` command with `train` and `visualize` subcommands
- Automatic TaxID/clade name resolution using TaxoPy
- Dynamic dataset building via `taxopy_clade.py` builder
- Artifact management: all outputs stored in `artifacts/tags/<tag>/`
- Metadata tracking: `run.json` stores training config, paths, dataset info

**Key Features:**
```bash
# Train any clade by name or TaxID
taxembed train Cnidaria -as cnidaria --epochs 100 --lambda 0.1
taxembed train 6073 -as echinoderms --epochs 50

# Visualize with automatic best checkpoint selection
taxembed visualize cnidaria
taxembed visualize echinoderms --children 1  # Color by grandchildren
```

#### **Dynamic Dataset Building**

**Created `src/taxembed/builders/taxopy_clade.py`:**
- Queries NCBI taxonomy via TaxoPy for all descendants of a clade
- Builds parent-child edges automatically
- Computes transitive closure (all ancestor-descendant pairs)
- Remaps to sequential indices for efficient training
- Writes manifest with provenance (root TaxID, name, node counts, etc.)
- Progress bars for long-running operations

**Benefits:**
- No manual data preparation needed
- Works for any taxonomic group
- Automatic handling of merged/obsolete TaxIDs
- Reproducible dataset generation

#### **Enhanced Visualization**

**Updated `visualize_multi_groups.py`:**
- Automatic best checkpoint selection per tag
- Hierarchical coloring: `--children` flag controls depth (0=children, 1=grandchildren, etc.)
- Informative titles: `"TaxEmbed: {CLADE}, Children Level {X}, epochs {Y}, Loss {L}"`
- Robust path resolution: works regardless of current working directory
- TaxoPy fallback: uses TaxoPy if local dump files are missing

**Visualization Features:**
- UMAP dimensionality reduction with proper Poincaré distance
- Color-coded by taxonomic groups (children/grandchildren of root)
- Automatic legend with group names and counts
- High-quality output suitable for publications

#### **Artifact Management**

**Organized Structure:**
```
artifacts/tags/
├── cnidaria/
│   ├── run.json              # Metadata (config, paths, dataset info)
│   ├── cnidaria.pth          # Checkpoints
│   ├── cnidaria_best.pth     # Best checkpoint
│   └── cnidaria_umap.png     # Visualizations
├── echinoderms/
│   └── ...
└── mammals/
    └── ...
```

**Metadata (`run.json`) includes:**
- Tag and slug
- Creation timestamp
- Dataset info (root TaxID, name, node counts, paths)
- Training config (epochs, learning rate, regularization, etc.)
- Paths to all artifacts (checkpoints, mapping files, data)

#### **Progress Feedback**

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Progress bars during dataset building (transitive closure computation)
- Color-coded training output (green for improvements, red for regressions)
- Clear status messages at each stage
- Automatic checkpoint path resolution

#### **Technical Achievements**

1. **Robust Path Handling:**
   - Scripts resolve paths relative to their own location
   - Works regardless of current working directory
   - Handles both absolute and relative checkpoint paths

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Graceful fallbacks (TaxoPy if dump files missing)
   - Clear error messages with actionable guidance
   - Validation of inputs before processing

3. **Code Organization:**
   - Shared utilities in `src/taxembed/utils/`
   - Modular builders in `src/taxembed/builders/`
   - Clean separation of concerns

#### **Example Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Train a model for Cnidaria (jellyfish, corals, etc.)
taxembed train Cnidaria -as cnidaria --epochs 100 --lambda 0.1

# This automatically:
# - Resolves "Cnidaria" to TaxID 6072
# - Builds dataset with all descendants
# - Trains model with specified hyperparameters
# - Saves checkpoints and metadata to artifacts/tags/cnidaria/

# 2. Visualize results
taxembed visualize cnidaria --children 0  # Color by immediate children

# 3. Try different coloring depths
taxembed visualize cnidaria --children 1  # Color by grandchildren
```

#### **Files Created/Modified**

**New Files:**
- `src/taxembed/cli/main.py` - Unified CLI entry point
- `src/taxembed/builders/taxopy_clade.py` - Dynamic dataset builder
- `src/taxembed/utils/data_validation.py` - Shared validation utilities
- `scripts/build_clade_dataset.py` - Standalone dataset builder script

**Modified Files:**
- `visualize_multi_groups.py` - Enhanced with hierarchical coloring and informative titles
- `train_small.py` - Updated to handle dynamic mapping files
- `pyproject.toml` - Added `taxopy` dependency and unified CLI entry point
- `README.md` - Updated with new CLI usage examples

#### **Lessons Learned**

1. **User Experience Matters:**
   - Single command workflows are much better than multi-step processes
   - Progress bars prevent perceived "hangs" during long operations
   - Informative titles help users understand what they're looking at

2. **Robustness is Critical:**
   - Path resolution must work from any directory
   - Fallbacks (TaxoPy) prevent failures when files are missing
   - Clear error messages save debugging time

3. **Metadata is Essential:**
   - Storing run metadata enables automatic visualization
   - Provenance tracking (dataset info) ensures reproducibility
   - Organized artifact structure makes it easy to find results

4. **Modular Design:**
   - Shared utilities prevent code duplication
   - Builders can be used standalone or via CLI
   - Clear separation allows independent testing

## Phase 11: v10a Architecture & Scaling (Feb 2026)

### **Architecture Evolution: v5 through v10a**

After the unified CLI (Phase 10), extensive experimentation refined the training architecture across ~20 tagged runs on Echinodermata and Mollusca.

#### **Key Architectural Discoveries**

**RiemannianAdam is Harmful (v5-v6):**
The Riemannian optimizer's conformal factor `((1-||p||^2)^2/4)` causes 110x gradient reduction at norm 0.9, destroying angular clustering for deep nodes. Depth-norm correlation r=+0.936 (great radial order) but angular clustering r=0.065 (destroyed).

**Euclidean Adam + Radial Nudge (v4/v9d) is the Answer:**
Post-step radial correction nudges norms toward depth-based targets without touching angular directions:
```python
new_norm = (1 - alpha) * current_norm + alpha * target_norm  # alpha = 0.05
```
This achieves BOTH radial hierarchy AND angular separation. Echinodermata v9d reached **r=+0.990 depth-norm, 1.68x class separation**.

**Euclidean Parametrization (v9+):**
`--euclidean-param` learns embeddings in R^d and maps to the Poincaré ball via `tanh(||z||/2)`. Eliminates gradient vanishing at the boundary entirely — gradients flow through tanh back to unconstrained z-space.

**Tiered Negative Sampling (v10a):**
Instead of uniform hard negatives, use 50% cousins (same depth) + 30% same class + 20% random. Vectorized by depth groups: O(unique_depths) instead of O(batch_size).

#### **Scaling Analysis: Dimension vs Clade Size**

| Clade | Nodes | Dim | Nodes/Dim | Depth-Norm r | Class Sep | Status |
|-------|-------|-----|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Echinodermata (v9d) | 7,833 | 10 | 783 | +0.990 | 1.68x | Excellent |
| Echinodermata (v4) | 7,833 | 10 | 783 | +0.950 | 1.21x | Good |
| Cnidaria (v10a) | 5,145 | 20 | 257 | — | — | Complete |
| Mammalia (v10a) | ~5,800 | 30 | ~193 | — | — | Complete |
| Mollusca (v10a-v11) | 53,720 | 100 | 537 | +0.650 | 1.11x | Needs improvement |

**Heuristic:** Keep nodes/dim in range 100-1000. Default dim=10 works for ~10K nodes but is grossly insufficient for 50K+.

#### **What Works (v10a Architecture)**

- Euclidean Adam optimizer (preserves angular gradients)
- Radial nudge 0.05 (enforces depth-radius without touching directions)
- Euclidean parametrization (eliminates boundary gradient vanishing)
- Curriculum learning for large/deep trees (`--curriculum --curriculum-phases 1:1,25:3,50:7`)
- Tiered negative sampling for large clades (`--tiered-negatives`)
- lambda_reg=0.1 (strong radial regularization)
- Per-batch ball projection (100% constraint compliance)

#### **What Didn't Work**

- RiemannianAdam (crushes angular gradients for deep nodes)
- dim=10 for clades >30K nodes (insufficient capacity)
- Short training (<5 epochs) — early stopping bug masked this initially
- Weak regularization (lambda < 0.05) — embeddings escape ball
- Euclidean distance in UMAP (must use Poincaré metric)
- MPS GPU acceleration — works but provides ~1.0x speedup (batch-granular sync overhead)

## Phase 12: Taxonomy Data Cleanup (Feb 2026)

### **The Problem: NCBI Taxonomy Noise**

An audit of Mollusca (53.7K nodes) revealed **51% of nodes are noise**:
- "sp." entries (unnamed species, barcoding vouchers): 33.6%
- "cf./aff./nr." (uncertain identifications): 5.1%
- Stale taxids (not in current NCBI dump): 8.5%
- "unclassified X" containers, environmental samples, hybrids

Training on noisy data produces artificially low loss (easy-to-place junk leaves) with degraded hierarchy quality.

### **Solution: `--clean` Flag**

Integrated noise filtering directly into `build_clade_dataset()` with a `--clean` flag:

```bash
# Build and train on cleaned taxonomy
taxembed train Arthropoda -as arthropoda_clean_v2 --clean --dim 200 --epochs 100
taxembed build Mollusca --clean  # Pre-build clean dataset
```

**Filtering strategy (bottom-up leaf pruning):**
1. Remove leaf nodes matching noise patterns (sp., cf., environmental, uncultured, unidentified, hybrid)
2. Remove leaf nodes not found in current NCBI dump (stale taxids)
3. Collapse container nodes ("unclassified X", "incertae sedis") whose children are all removed
4. Repeat until stable
5. Re-parent through removed internal nodes to preserve tree structure

**Results:**

| Clade | Before | After | Removed | Speedup |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| Arthropoda | 979,570 | 275,651 | 71.9% | ~3.4x fewer pairs |
| Mollusca | 53,720 | ~26,000 | ~51% | ~3.5x fewer pairs |

### **MPS GPU Benchmark**

Benchmarked Apple Silicon MPS against CPU at all scales up to Arthropoda 980K x 400:
- **Result: ~1.0x speedup** (effectively no benefit)
- Root cause: per-batch sync overhead in the training loop (sparse embedding lookups, `torch.unique` projection)
- **Conclusion:** Data cleanup (3.4x fewer nodes) is the real optimization, not GPU acceleration

### **Training Loop Optimizations**

Despite MPS not helping, several loop optimizations were implemented:
- **Fused batch transfer:** Concatenate all index tensors, transfer once to device, then slice back (reduces 4 syncs to 2)
- **Deferred projection:** `project_to_ball` with `torch.unique` runs every 50 batches instead of every batch
- **MPS mixed precision:** `torch.amp.autocast` extended to MPS backend (previously CUDA-only)
- **MPS device selection:** Enabled MPS in device selection (was previously disabled with misleading "can hang" comment)

### **First Arthropoda Training Run**

With the clean dataset, Arthropoda became trainable on a laptop:
- **275,651 clean nodes** (was 979,570), **4.5M pairs** (was 15.4M)
- dim=200, batch=128, n_neg=100, tiered negatives, euclidean param, curriculum
- **1 epoch: ~5 min on M3 CPU, loss=0.850**
- Norms: [0.228, 0.794, 0.991] (proper depth stratification from epoch 1)
